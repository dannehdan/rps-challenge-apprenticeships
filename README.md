# Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge

A simulation of a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer. The user enters their name, then chooses which of the three options they want to pick. The computer then randomly decides what it would like to choose, and the result is evaluated.

The running score of the user vs. the computer is displayed, and a user can choose to play the computer again, or start a new game with a different name.
